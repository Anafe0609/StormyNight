This is a generative writing with visual and audio contents, processed by using p5.js. It is a try on horror fiction, by generating endless sentences which may not be related to the others. In horror fictions, to create discomforting atmosphere, writers spend lots of words on describing the horror scenes, including the environment and the reaction of characters. When these words were used for creating a new sentence, will that sentence have the similar atmosphere? In other words, will a phrase or word carry certain kind of mood? Visual and audio elements also coorperate deeply with the sentences. In what extent will these further emphasize the atmosphere. These are some questions I am exploring in this work.

Markov chain was used as the main algorithm to generate natural language. For the contents, they are from several horror fictions, which are describing either murder, beasts, monsters, corpse, thunderstorm or heavy rain. Each of the horror topics will have corresponding images, which will appear shortly when there is lightning.
